i-bus-interface
===============

This project consists of a Bluetooth adapter that is connected
to the BMW I-Bus and an Android app that talks to the I-Bus
using the adapter.

The main goal of this project is to use the up and down buttons on
the BMW E46 steering wheel to send previous track and next track
commands to the music player on an Android device.

Cadsoft Eagle v6 files for the adapter are in the hardware directory
and Android software is in the android directory.
